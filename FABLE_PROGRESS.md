# FABLE_BRIEF.md — Progress Log

Session log for the full optimization run. See FABLE_BRIEF.md for the phase definitions.

## Phase 1 — Component refactor ✅ DONE (2026-07-13)

All six dashboard tabs >600 lines split into focused components. Behavior unchanged
(pure extraction — code moved verbatim, only imports/exports added). `npm run build`
verified after each tab.

| Tab | Before | After (main) | New directory |
|---|---|---|---|
| TradingTab | 2,894 | 495 | `tabs/trading/` — helpers.ts, TradeAnnotationModal, VelquorChat, analytics-shared (StatRow/TableHeader), TraderRadar, TradingInsights, YourEdge, EquityCurve, PositionSizeCalc, ReportDownloadBar, TradeLogTable, useTradeFilters.ts |
| PortfolioTab | 1,320 | 463 | `tabs/portfolio/` — helpers.ts, CsvImportModal (+ exported parseCSV/parseNum/detectColumns/guessAssetType for tests), TickerSearch, HoldingModal, DonutChart (+BREAKDOWN_CATS) |
| JournalTab | 928 | 453 | `tabs/journal/` — helpers.ts (Mood, calendar fns), EntryModal, WeeklyReviewSection |
| CopyTradingTab | 919 | 127 | `tabs/copy/` — types.ts, styles.ts, helpers.tsx, AddAccountModal, CreateGroupModal, SignalLog, GroupCard, PlanGateBanner, HowItWorks |
| OverviewTab | 861 | 339 | `tabs/overview/` — helpers.tsx (useIsMobile, fmt fns), MarketStrip, WinRing, TradeCalendar (+DayDetailPanel), StreakCards |
| DisciplineTab | 683 | 328 | `tabs/discipline/` — helpers.ts, AddHabitModal, AddTaskModal, TaskRow |

New hook: `tabs/trading/useTradeFilters.ts` (symbol/direction filter + pagination,
filter change resets page — same behavior as before).

Notes:
- DashboardShell imports (default exports) unchanged.
- CSV parse helpers in `tabs/portfolio/CsvImportModal.tsx` are exported — Phase 3 test targets.

## Phase 2 — Landing page performance ✅ DONE (2026-07-13)

- `app/page.tsx`: 2,314 → 34 lines. Now a **server component** composing 20 section
  files in `components/landing/`. Client islands ('use client') only where needed:
  Counter, AnimatedDashboard, Nav, Hero, StatsBar, BeforeAfterMockup, ShowcaseSection,
  Features, HowItWorks, VelquorSection, PropFirmSection, Pricing, Footer,
  AutoSyncVisual, CopierVisual, ScrollSetup (body-overflow effect). Server-rendered
  (no JS shipped): Aurora, AIAnalysisVisual, ThreePillars, FooterTagline.
- **Deleted dead code**: `DashboardMockup` (129 lines) and `TradingTabMockup`
  (137 lines) were defined in page.tsx but never rendered anywhere.
- BeforeAfterMockup lazy-loaded via next/dynamic inside ShowcaseSection (below fold).
- `app/login/page.tsx`: 947 → 578 lines. Aurora → `components/login/Aurora.tsx`;
  340-line LoginDashboardPreview → own chunk via next/dynamic.
- `/pricing` left as-is (317 lines; entire page depends on the annual toggle state —
  no meaningful server split available).
- `@react-pdf/renderer` verified server-only already (only imported in
  `app/api/reports/route.ts`, listed in serverExternalPackages) — nothing to do.
- `next.config.ts`: added poweredByHeader:false, image formats (avif/webp) +
  Supabase storage remotePattern (ready for future next/image adoption).
- Note: most landing sections use `useLocale` (client-side navigator locale
  detection) so they must stay client islands; converting locale to Accept-Language
  server detection would make the route dynamic and lose static caching — not done.

## Phase 3 — Tests — not started
## Phase 4 — TradingView design upgrade — not started
## Phase 5 — API hardening — not started
